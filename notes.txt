What is React JS 

It is a js library for building user interfaces
> declarative, it makes you wirte code with the question of what instead of how something is to be done. it also allows your code to be fmore predictable and easier to debug
> Component - based - allows you to write reusable, complex ui components ina quickl and efficient manner
> learn once, write anywhere : react can also be used on the server using node and power mobile apps using react nativ


What problem does it solve?

applications that require frequent and rapid changes in page data are resource intensive and complicated to code.

separate concerns into components rather than technologies instead of the conventional HTML for structure, css for styling, and JS for interactivity

Apply lrapid updates using virtual DOM. This only works on th differences between the current DOM state and the target DOM state.

Store information in a component using states
